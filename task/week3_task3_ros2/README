Week 3 – Task: SLAM Mapping with TurtleBot3 (ROS2 Humble)
Overview

This task demonstrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using TurtleBot3 in ROS2 Humble.
The robot explores a Gazebo environment while building a 2D occupancy grid map, which is later used for navigation.

Requirements

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

ROS2 Humble installed

Steps
1. Launch Gazebo Simulation
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py

2. Start SLAM Toolbox
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py use_sim_time:=True

3. Open RViz2
rviz2

Add Map and LaserScan displays.

Observe the map forming as the robot explores.

4. Teleoperate the Robot
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
Use arrow keys to move around the world.

Mapping updates in RViz2.

5. Save the Map

When mapping is complete:
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/sim_map
This generates:

sim_map.yaml

sim_map.pgm

Validation

Map loads correctly in RViz2

Robot explores and builds occupancy grid

Map saved as YAML + PGM files
